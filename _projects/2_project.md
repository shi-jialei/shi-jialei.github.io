    soft Laparoscope
    ---

The hand-held soft laparosope can fit to standard 12 mm trocar port and can be operated by a touch interface. Details are reported in the [TMRB paper](/assets/pdf/Shi_TMRB_2024.pdf).

    Self-propelled endoscope
    ---

This work presents the design, control and evaluation of a self-growing soft robotic colonoscope, leveraging the evertion principle. The device features a tube with an 18 mm diameter, constructed from stretchable fabric, which grows 1.6 m at the tip under pressurization. A pneumatically driven, elastomer-based manipulator enables omni-directional steering over 180 degrees at the tip. The robot operates in two modes: teleoperation via joysticks and autonomous navigation using sensor inputs, such as a tip-mounted camera. Thorough in-vitro experiments are conducted to assess the system's functionality and performance. Results illustrate that the robot can achieve locomotion in confined spaces such as a colon phantom, while exerting contact forces averaging less than 0.3 N. This work is funded by the 5-million [EPSRC Project EP/X033546/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX033546%2F1) led by [Prof. Ferdinando Rodriguez Y Baena](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/f.rodriguez) and partially supported by the [Multi-scale Medical Robotics Center, The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.mrc-cuhk.com/).
