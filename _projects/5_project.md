    Active Interactive Compliance Regulation
    ---

The exhibited compliance of soft robots can be actively regulated to be stiffer or softer than its passive compliance. More details are in [T-Mech paper](/assets/pdf/Shi_T-Mech_2025.pdf).

    Haptic Finger Tip Device
    ---
    
A [haptic fingertip device](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51779-8) is developed led by [Dr. Sara Abad Guaman](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/75742-sara-abad-guaman) and [Prof. Helge Arne Wurdemann](https://helge-wurdemann.com/) from UCL. To advance the device’s Technology Readiness Level (TRL), I worked as a Research Assistant from December 2022 to December 2023, during which I further developed the system’s electronics and control interface. In collaboration with my colleague [Dr. Wenlong Gaozhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vhKVcqsAAAAJ&hl=en), we created a fully portable system. The device shows strong potential for use in robot-assisted surgery by enabling haptic feedback during interactions with cancerous tissues. It may also serve as a diagnostic tool for assessing fingertip sensory perception.

The device is featured in mainstream media, including [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/514f4021-7d35-46cf-a22c-2de1c68caafc), the [Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/ucl-university-college-london-b1181550.html), and [the Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/robot-touch-hand-skin-ucl-b2611450.html).
