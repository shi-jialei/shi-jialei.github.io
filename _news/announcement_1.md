RSS Pioneers is an intensive workshop for senior Ph.D. students and early career researchers in the robotics community. Held in conjunction with the main [Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference](https://roboticsconference.org/), each year the RSS Pioneers brings together a cohort of the worldâ€™s top early-career researchers. The workshop aims to provide these promising researchers with networking opportunities and help to navigate their next career stages, and foster creativity and collaboration surrounding challenges in all areas of robotics. In 2024, 30 Pioneers are selected worldwide and the acceptance rate is 15%.
