My research sits at the intersection of soft robotics, mechatronic system design and integration, and the development of fundamental models to better understand their behaviour â€” with a strong emphasis on healthcare applications such as minimally invasive surgery and haptic feedback systems.

I bring extensive hands-on experience in the design, modelling, and control of soft robotic systems, grounded in a solid foundation across mechanical and electronic engineering. My work has been recognized internationally, including selection as an [RSS Pioneer (2024)](https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2024/participants?authuser=0), receipt of the [IEEE RA-L Outstanding Reviewer Award (2025)](https://www.ieee-ras.org/images/awards/RAS_2025_ICRA_Brochure.pdf). I (co)-authored multiple publications in leading robotics journals such as IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR), and IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics (T-Mech).

I aim to bridge engineering innovation with translational clinical impact by developing cutting-edge and intelligent robotic platforms for next-generation medical technologies.
